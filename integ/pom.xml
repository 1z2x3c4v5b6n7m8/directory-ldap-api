  <!-- 
     NOTE: This is a temporary module and area where we may
     decide to remove it after figuring out a better place 
     to put these tests. For now it keeps tests that would 
     otherwise clutter shared-schema or cause cycles if put
     in the rightful position where they belong.

     The odd ldap api tests can be put here, it matters not
     that they depend on ApacheDS jars for the test scope,
     since this module is not used for anything other than 
     integration tests.

  <description>
    A place to put integration tests that if put in their rightful
    project position would incure some cyclic dependencies even if
    the dependencies were test scoped dependencies.
